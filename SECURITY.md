# Ares Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Currently, the only supported Ares version is whatever the current one is (as shown in the [README](https://github.com/ls1intum/Ares/blob/main/README.md)).
See the [Wiki](https://github.com/ls1intum/Ares/wiki) for the changes and how to adjust your tests to them.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If the security problem relates to a bug that is associated with unexpected behavior or inconvenience or something non-critical is broken,
simply report it as a bug and [use the bug report template for that](https://github.com/ls1intum/Ares/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=bug_report.md&title=).

If what you discovered could be used maliciously or is in another way an actual security vulnerability, please do not make the issue public, but follow these steps:
- similar to a bug report, collect information how it can be reproduced
- state the system and the versions that are used, especially your Ares-Version.
- provide additional information and context, if possible
- write that in an email to c.femers@tum.de (if you wish to use PGP, the fingerprint for the email address is `80703280C4ACE4256AABFF825E2C13E54FFC3F2A`)

You should get a reply from me in the next 1-2 days.
I will create a Security Advisory draft that will be published when the vulnerability is resolved.
Should that take over a week, I will you inform you upfront if possible and report the progress after the week and how it is going.

*Even better: Name your GitHub-Account in the email so I can add you to the discussion of the Security Advisory draft!*
